# transcriptions
This is a repository to hold all my by-ear transciptions.  I've commited to
doing at least one transcription per month to both learn musical notation in
MuseScore and to practice my ear training.

Format
------
All files are in Musescore's uncompressed format (.mcsx) so they can be parsed
as XML.
